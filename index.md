## Notes

- Part I (chapters 1-6) mirrors Part II (chapters 7-12) in reverse — the novel's structure is a tango
- Each chapter heading is followed by a single large decorated capital letter (drop cap) on the next line
- Chapter 11 is notably the shortest (238 lines); Chapter 4 is the longest (965 lines)
